110726 refreshed code from https://gitorious.org/pyosc/devel
       now should work with python3 (at last)

* TODO


* notes
this version should work with python2 and python3.
** liblo
for compilation with python3 on osx, you might have to add
'-I/usr/local/include'
in ext_modules compile_args

* usage
** see tests folder
** quick start
put vsosc folder wherever you need it.

in your python script:


# if vsosc is in the parent path:
# import sys
# sys.path.append('..')
# or import ..vsosc

import vsosc

# define a test function
def test(*msg):
 print (msg)

# define a server or receiver
r = vsosc.Receiver(); r.init() # you have to initialize!
r.bind('/test', test)

# define a client or sender
s = Sender(); s.init()
s.send('/test', ('it should work!', 22))

# don't forget to quit the server or your program will hang.
r.quit()
